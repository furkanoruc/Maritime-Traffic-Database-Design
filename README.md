# Maritime-Traffic-Database-Design
A relational database is designed for maritime traffic in the scope of Database Systems class by Dr. Rafal Angryk. Below is the hypothetical process is introduced. Project report can be accessed through: https://furkanoruc.github.io/Maritime-Traffic-Database-Design/Report.pdf

SafeMarine is a maritime technology startup􏰃 specializing in prevention of potential maritime
accidents in narrow and congested waterways􏰁 SafeMarine provides spatio􏰄temporal data based analytics solutions to their customers􏰁 They rely heavily on maritime data and their data analytics processes require specialized relational database designs􏰃 speci􏰅c for their analytics purposes􏰁.

Primary data source utilized by SafeMarine is Automatic Identi􏰅cation System 􏰆AIS􏰇 data􏰁 AIS messages are transmitted by marine vessels and they include static􏰃 dynamic and voyage related information􏰁 AIS is frequently used by maritime authorities around the world to obtain live information on vessels􏰈 identity􏰃 position􏰃 length􏰃 speed􏰃 estimated arrival time to the port and others􏰁 Since AIS is transmitted and stored in a mass and unstructured way􏰃 the raw version is not useful for analytics purposes􏰁 In the scope of this technical report􏰃 a relational database management system design is presented for SafeMarine'􏰈s business purposes􏰁.
